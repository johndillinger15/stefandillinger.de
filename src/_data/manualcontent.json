    "content": "In late 2017 I pressed record on the very first episode of the Epigenetics Podcast. My goal was to speak with the field’s leading voices and uncover the stories behind their discoveries. Since then this project has grown into a living library of 150 chapters spanning four days and nine hours of deep scientific dialogue cataloging the advancements and debates in epigenetics. Each episode adds a new volume to our archive. With over 275,000 downloads and a new release every two weeks, the podcast serves as both reference and tour guide. In this article I invite you to stroll the shelves with me, exploring highlights from these 150 episodes and kicking off a series of Articles that summarises the key lessons I learned from conversations with Epigenetics’ key opinion leaders.",
